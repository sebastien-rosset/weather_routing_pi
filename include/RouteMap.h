 * - Management of configuration parameters for the routing calculation
 * - Integration with weather data (GRIB files and climatology)
 * - Error conditions and status reporting
 * - Thread safety for the potentially long-running calculation
 *
 * The core algorithm works by repeatedly propagating from the current isochrone
 * to create new ones until either the destination is reached or no further
 * progress can be made. At each step, positions are evaluated based on vessel
 * capabilities, weather conditions, land avoidance, and other configured
 * constraints.
