 * means the positions form a complete circuit where the last position connects
 * back to the first position, creating a continuous perimeter with no gaps or
 * endpoints.
 *
 * These boundaries (isochrones) expand outward as travel time increases,
 * creating concentric regions of accessibility from the starting point.
 *
 * The class supports:
 * - Normal regions (direction = 1) representing areas the vessel can reach.
 * - Inverted regions (direction = -1) representing "holes" or areas within a
 * normal region that cannot be reached (e.g., islands or other obstacles)
 * - Parent-child relationships for handling nested regions.
 *
 * IsoRoute provides methods for merging, normalizing (removing intersections),
 * checking containment, and propagating routes to create the next isochrone.
